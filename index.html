        Achieving true zero waste in society is a daunting challenge, one that leaves many overwhelmed and unwilling to even start looking for solutions. We live in a world where trying to cut down on your carbon footprint and consume less plastic is met with resistance almost every step of the way. Until we need to ask for plastic, napkins, and little packets of ketchup instead of having them force fed to us, nothing is going to change.
        <br />
        <br />
        No Waste Race participants will show everyone just how possible a zero waste existence can be when we try at it!
      </p>
      <h2>What am I signing up for?</h2>
      <p class="mission-statement">
        The world’s first zero waste 5k! We’re having it early in the morning on a weekday so that we don’t cut into your weekend plans and so you can still make it to work. After the race we’ll have coffee, bagels, and juice to eat as we celebrate what we’ve just accomplished - the first 5k in the world that produced no waste!
      </p>
